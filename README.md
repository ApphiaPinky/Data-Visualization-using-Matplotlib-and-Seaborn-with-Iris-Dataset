The Iris dataset contains measurements of iris flowers from three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each sample includes the following features:

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width

This project aims to visualize these features to gain insights into the relationships between them and the species of the flowers. The visualizations are generated using:

Matplotlib: A powerful library for creating static, animated, and interactive plots.

Seaborn: A data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
